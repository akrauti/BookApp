# BookApp

BookApp is an application that you can use to manage a collection of books. In the current version it uses [MongoDB  Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) as its database. I chose Atlas because it doesn't require any input from the user to get running, so no need to download or install any additional software.

The main goal and inspiration for this project was Simplicity. I wanted to create a one page web page that has a REST API as its back-end and a simple and an easy to use intuitive UI for the app itself. I have done applications that work similarly to this previously but I still learned something new especially in the React way of thinking.
